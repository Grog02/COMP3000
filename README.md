##Project Background
Bullet by Bullet is a 3D Turn-Based strategy shooter game. The player controls five blue units that look like crash test dummies and their mission is to eliminate all of the enemies in the building. All units, both enemy and friendly, have 100  health. The building has walls and pillars for the player’s units to take cover and work around, it allows for the player to take a defensive approach to the situation. 

##Project Goals
The main goal for the creation of ‘Bullet by Bullet’ was to take the commonly explored territory of fast-paced shooter games and offer a unique twist: slowing down the pace by opting for a turn-based system. This creates a more unique experience for the player that advocates a more methodical and tactical approach to the game. 

Allowing the player to take their time and plan an approach can allow for a much calmer gaming experience as opposed to games where players are given little to no time to think which can often lead to panicked decisions.

An important goal for Bullet by Bullet was to encourage tactical decision-making whilst also being accommodating enough to allow for diverse playstyles. 
Encouraging a thoughtful attack style enhances the strategic depth of gameplay and applies more importance to each move as it will impact the encounters and, ultimately, the end result. With this, it enriches the game with a deeper level of engagement and makes for a more strategic yet enjoyable experience.
